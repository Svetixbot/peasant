# Peasant Multiplication

The algorithm can be found [here](http://www.cut-the-knot.org/Curriculum/Algebra/PeasantMultiplication.shtml)

# Tech choice

 - `Rust` language, cause I was inspired by [Dave Herman's talk at Curry on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OHcJzJQ2Nk) and wanted to see what the heck is it about.

 - [`Quickcheck`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/quickcheck) implementation in Rust, cause property-based testing was such a good fit for this problem.
